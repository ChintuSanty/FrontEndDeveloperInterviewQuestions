## What is HTML? {#wih}
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of websites and web applications. HTML is the foundation of web development and is used to define the structure and layout of a web page by employing a system of markup tags.

HTML uses a set of elements, represented by tags, to describe the different parts of a web page's content. These elements can define headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and various other components that make up a web page.

A typical HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used, followed by the <html> element, which serves as the root element. Inside the <html> element, you'll typically find the <head> and <body> elements.

The <head> element contains metadata about the document, such as the page title, links to stylesheets and scripts, and other information that's not directly displayed on the page. The <body> element contains the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and interactive elements.

HTML is complemented by other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and functionality of web pages. CSS is used to control the layout, formatting, and styling of the HTML elements, while JavaScript enables dynamic and interactive features.

Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render them into the visual web pages that users see and interact with. As HTML is continuously evolving, the latest version is HTML5, which brings new elements, attributes, and features to make web development more powerful and efficient.

## What is the latest version of HTML? {#witlvoh}
HTML5 is the fifth and most current version of the Hypertext Markup Language and is widely used for creating and structuring web content. It introduced many new features, elements, and attributes, making it more powerful and versatile compared to its predecessors.

HTML5 brought significant improvements to web development, such as better support for multimedia elements (audio and video), canvas for 2D graphics rendering, semantic elements for improved document structure, native form validation, and support for local storage, among other enhancements.
