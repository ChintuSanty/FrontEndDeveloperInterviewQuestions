### 2. What is the difference between HTML & HTML 5 ?
<p>
    HTML is the original markup language used for creating and designing web pages, while HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. Here are some of the key differences between HTML and HTML5:

1. Multimedia support: HTML has limited support for multimedia content, while HTML5 offers better support for audio, video, and other types of multimedia.

2. Form controls: HTML5 offers new form controls, such as date pickers, sliders, and range controls, which make it easier to create interactive forms.

3. Canvas and SVG: HTML5 includes support for the Canvas and SVG graphics APIs, which enable developers to create complex, interactive graphics and animations directly in the browser.

4. Local storage: HTML5 provides a new way to store data locally on the user's device, using the Local Storage API.

5. Semantic markup: HTML5 includes new semantic markup elements, such as `<article>`,`<section>`,`<nav>` which provide a clearer structure for web content and improve accessibility.

Overall, HTML5 offers new features and capabilities that make it easier to create modern, interactive web pages and applications.

### 3. Why do we need `<!DOCTYPE html>` in HTML?
<p>
    The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is used to inform the web browser about the version of HTML that the web page is written in. It is placed at the top of an HTML document before the `<html>` tag.

    The DOCTYPE declaration helps the web browser to render the web page correctly and avoid rendering errors. The DOCTYPE declaration defines the rules and elements that the web browser should use to render the page, such as the syntax and character encoding.

    For example, the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is:
        `<!DOCTYPE html>`
    This tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5 and should be rendered according to the HTML5 specification.

    Without a DOCTYPE declaration, the web browser may not be able to render the web page correctly, resulting in display errors or even a broken page.

### 4. Purpose of `<title>` tag:
<p>
    The title tag in HTML is used to define the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab when the page is opened. The title tag is also used by search engines to display the title of the page in the search results.
</p>

### 5. Purpose of `<meta ...>` tag:
<p>
    The meta tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about the document, such as keywords, description, author, and viewport settings for mobile devices. This information is used by search engines, browsers, and other web applications.
</p>

### 6. Scemantic In HTML:
<p>
    Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that focuses on the meaning and purpose of the content, rather than just its appearance. Semantic HTML uses specific tags that describe the type of content they contain, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. This makes the content more accessible to users with disabilities, and also helps search engines and other web applications to understand and process the content more accurately.
